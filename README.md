Refactor the code to something nicer!

There is no right answer, it's about getting to a cleaner solution.

Taken from a [refactoring golf exercise](https://github.com/daviddenton/refactoring-golf) by Mr Dave. 

## typescript

you should be good to execute `./run.sh` and be setup... 

if not then it's a `nvm use` to use the right version of node followed by `npm install`
