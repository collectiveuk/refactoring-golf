# Refactoring Golf

Refactor the code to something nicer!

There is no right answer, it's about getting to a cleaner solution.

Taken from a [refactoring golf exercise](https://github.com/daviddenton/refactoring-golf) by Mr Dave. 

## Typescript

You should be good to execute `./run.sh` and be setup...

If not then it's a `nvm use` to use the right version of node followed by `npm install`

### Run tests in watch mode

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```
